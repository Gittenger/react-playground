# React playground for building components

This project is a place where I can build components in an isolated environment away from other projects in production and development.

The main usage is to create a number of reusable components which I can then store in my own personal library of components to use in any project, reducing my work later.

Perhaps I will eventually even assemble them all in an npm package. But perhaps having the components in their own project on github and using git clone will be sufficient for my personal usage, for now.
